# Movie Reviews
This project is created using the New York Times Movie Reviews API, and also using the search that Movie Reviews API ofers.
If you want to clone and rund this repo you need to creat a .env.local file in the root folder of the repo, and also register account with [New York Times Development API](https://developer.nytimes.com/?mcubz=0) and using your API Key inside the .env.local file.
The variable that I have used is Called REACT_APP_NYT_API_KEY but you can rename it (don't forget to change the variable in the project too if you change it)
